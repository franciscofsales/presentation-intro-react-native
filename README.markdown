# Intro to React Native

A slidedeck on React Native prepared for absolutely unfamiliarized people.
Highly inspired by the talk by [Leland Richardson & Filipe Lima](https://speakerdeck.com/felipecsl/react-native-at-airbnb)

Built using [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle), based off their boilerplate.

## Development

After cloning the repo, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're into that)

Then, to start up the local server, run `yarn start` (again with that stuff).

Open a browser and hit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000), and you are ready to roll
